---

## [1.8.0] - 2025-08
### Added
  - **Overhaul of the OCR (capture tool for route display)**
      - Broader OCR active window selection
        - Now uses a number of factors to determine which window is the correct PokeMMO window. PokeMMO window must be focused to have data update.
      - Support for most UI Scales
        - OCR will now attempted to magnify the route capture if it appears too small, and continue to loop until a useable route can be found. This should help pull data for most UI scale sizes.
      - Windowed Mode Support
        - OCR will now correctly target the route in a Windowed screen.
       
  - **Pokemon Moveset Data**
      - Some Pokemon have been updated to include moveset data and egg groups.
          - This lays down groundwork for a full moveset and data implementation.
       
  - **Region Selection Filter**
      - Added dropdown in the 'Areas' tab to filter between regions

  - **Patch Notes Button**
      - Added a button so you'll never miss the juice
   
  - **View Pokemon from the Live Tab**
      - Added an option to "View" a Pokemon directly out of the Live tab. 
 
### Fixed
- **OCR "jitter" has been drastically reduced**
     - OCR now uses a combination of factors to minimize the jitter of detecting a route & no_route experienced before.
     - Route data is temporarily stored and pushed to user until a deterministic difference can be identified. It then references the local database for a known route location, if it matches, it updates.
     - OCR has improved filtering of artifacts when moving through screens that make it hard to read what the route says.
- **Route Search Keyword Mistmatch**
     - Better hadnling of route names between regions and how keywords filter these names.
