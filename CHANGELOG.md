---

## [1.8.0] - 2025-08
### Added
  - **Overhaul of the OCR (capture tool for route display)**
      - Broader OCR active window selection
        - Now uses a number of factors to determine which window is the correct PokeMMO window. PokeMMO window must be focused to have data update.
      - Support for most UI Scales
        - OCR will now attempted to magnify the route capture if it appears too small, and continue to loop until a useable route can be found. This should help pull data for most UI scale sizes.
      - Windowed Mode Support
        - OCR will now correctly target the route in a Windowed screen.
       
  - **Pokemon Moveset Data**
      - Some Pokemon have been updated to include moveset data and egg groups.
          - This lays down groundwork for a full moveset and data implementation.
       
  - **Region Selection Filter**
      - Added dropdown in the 'Areas' tab to filter between regions

  - **Patch Notes Button**
      - Added a button so you'll never miss the juice
   
  - **View Pokemon from the Live Tab**
      - Added an option to "View" a Pokemon directly out of the Live tab. 
 
### Fixed
- **OCR "jitter" has been drastically reduced**
     - OCR now uses a combination of factors to minimize the jitter of detecting a route & no_route experienced before.
     - Route data is temporarily stored and pushed to user until a deterministic difference can be identified. It then references the local database for a known route location, if it matches, it updates.
     - OCR has improved filtering of artifacts when moving through screens that make it hard to read what the route says.
- **Route Search Keyword Mistmatch**
     - Better hadnling of route names between regions and how keywords filter these names.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08
### Added
- Live Route feed (beta)
  - A new Live tab that auto-detects your current area from the top-left PokeMMO HUD and shows the matching encounter table.
  - OCR helper (LiveRouteOCR)
    - Lightweight native helper that screenshots the HUD, runs OCR, and streams results to the app over WebSocket.
  - Channel-suffix handling
    - Location strings like Route 212 Ch. 1 are normalized to Route 212 before matching, so channel info no longer interferes.
  - Fuzzy location matching
    - Noisy OCR (extra spaces/stray characters) is cleaned/normalized and mapped to the right route/town with tolerant matching.

- Debug hooks
  - Optional logging with last screenshot and OCR text to help diagnose mismatches.

### Improvements
- UI: New tab switcher (Pokémon / Areas / Live) with a status chip (Connected/Disconnected) and live location line.

- Resilience: Helper start/stop is sandboxed—failure to launch no longer crashes the app; the app continues to run and you’ll just see “Start LiveRouteOCR…”.

- Performance: Smarter capture region and pre-processing for sharper OCR, plus throttled updates to avoid flicker.

### Fixed
- Route name not appearing: Normalization now strips Ch. x and other HUD glyphs so the Live tab actually resolves to your route.
- Intermittent blank reads: Better focus detection for the PokeMMO window and retries when the HUD animates.
- Portable build spawn error (ENOENT): The app now launches the helper from process.resourcesPath in packaged/portable builds.
- Missing app icon (Windows): Electron build now embeds the icon and the window uses it correctly.
- Packaging / Dev
  - Portable EXE: Added Electron-Builder config to ship a single portable .exe.
  - Extra resources include live-helper/ and icon.ico.
  - Safer process management: Helper process is cleaned up on app exit; spawn errors are surfaced in a friendly dialog and log.
  - Tessdata & logs: Helper looks for bundled tessdata; debug artifacts are written to %LOCALAPPDATA%\PokemmoLive\ (last capture, log).
